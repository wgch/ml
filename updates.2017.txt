1. The website is not catchy. It looks like a word document copy pasted into the website.
 
2. A careers tab be included
 
3. Colour quality to be improved so as to be catchy.
 
4. A brief explanation of each area of practice would be nice.
 
5. On the home page, under litigation; While family law litigation is well captured, I feel commercial litigation is not. It feels like we only do debt collection under “what we do.” Under the head “Recoveries, Security realization” we have also only put in debt collection. Corporate and Commercial Law also disappeared under “what we do”
 
6. Include a tab for Resources. This essentially would serve as a platform where we upload our refined  material  on topical /legal issues/ analysis of new enactments and / or  the in-house CLE presentations


1. Catchiness of the website – there have been varying views on the website design. We will retain the current design. However, the font is wanting – it is not uniform. Please address this.
2. Career Tab – should cover vacancies at the firm (including internships).
3. Resources Tab – should provide access to articles and presentations that we prepare.
4. Content – I note the comment about missing content (refer to Joyce’s email of 22nd August 2016). Please compare with our current content and ensure that nothing is missing.
