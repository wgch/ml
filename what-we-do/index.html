                        <p class="lead">Alternative forms of dispute resolution are fast gaining popularity between disputants in Kenya as a faster and cheaper way to resolve issues in civil, commercial, employment and family matters. This growing preference for a  parties-driven and confidential approach to conflict resolution has also be taken up by the court system, through a mediation pilot project that was laughed in 2016. More and more, disputants are finding that the simpler, quicker and more lasting way to resolve disputes is to focus on their interests in disputes, rather than purely on their legal positions.</p>
