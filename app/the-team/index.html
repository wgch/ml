                        <h4>I Will Fight For You</h4>
                        <p>My undying love for debates and the scheming that come with it is the winner here. The nuances, intricacies and subtleties that comes interpretation of and execution of the law always drew me in the direction of law.</p>
                        <p>I come from humble beginnings: born and raised in Nakuru County (read Mwigito and Warubaga).  From Saint Francis Nursery School, through Michinda Boarding Primary School, Koelel Secondary School, University of Nairobi and Kenya School of Law.</p>
                        <p>I interned at Mathenge Gitonga & Company Advocates in December 2010 through August 2011.</p>
                        <p>I interned and underwent pupillage at the firm of Waruhiu KOwade & Ng’ang’a Advocates (WKN) from September 2011 to November 2012 when I was admitted. In November 2012, upon Admission as an Advocate of the High Court of Kenya, I was employed as an associate at WKN until December 2013 whence I resigned to join Musyimi & Company (MC) in January 2014. I have been with the firm since.</p>
                        <p>When dealing with my clients, I eschew bureaucracy and espouse pragmatism. Every case turns on its own facts. As such, emotional intelligence comes in handy every now and then.</p>
                        <p>I love reading with a heavy bias towards general knowledge. Occasionally I will play chess, Sudoku, Scrabble. I enjoy power walks and very rarely swimming.</p>

                        <h4>Why Your Happiness Is My Priority</h4>
                        <p>There are a great many admirable professions in the world open to a young, inquisitive and able intellect. I ended up in Law for various reasons, including watching my own mother start and successfully run her own law firm. </p>
                        <p>However, it was my love of reading and public performance that really got me started on the path that eventually led me to pursue my studies in Law. I enjoyed delving into literature and was happy to take up a stage of any sort. Little by little, it seemed that a career that allowed me to use my mind engaged in issues and speak out for others, using both those skills to solve problems made sense. And this is how I ended up studying Law. </p>
                        <p>My 2010 pupillage was conducted under a progressive and thorough Pupil Master who gave me a love for the academic side of law and life. I then lectured part-time for a year, following which I returned to full-time legal work at Musyimi & Company Advocates in January 2012. </p>
                        <p>I started off right away in family law work and loved it! Despite the difficult and emotional nature of family matters, it was very satisfying to be able to journey with clients through these difficult times and provide a listening ear, and more importantly, sound legal advice on their family issues.</p>
                        <p>It wasn’t until early 2014 that I was admitted to the Bar as an Advocate of the High Court to fully begin my career in litigation. Since then I have included civil, employment and commercial litigation to my case repertoire. However, it is through doing family law work that I learned about the nuances of good conflict management and that has aided in all my litigation work since.</p>
                        <p>I approach my work with the aim of finding workable solutions for and with the parties who engage me. Apart from my litigation work, I am also a trained and certified mediator. Both of these avenues of dispute resolution require good listening skills, an appreciation for both sides of the argument, and a healthy respect for the final decision maker. </p>
                        <p>With all this in mind, I aim to help my clients get results that are most advantageous to themselves without sacrificing their businesses, employees, investments or family relationships. In the long run, clients really do want a solution they can live with when the fight is over.</p>
                        <p>My early love of reading continues, to which I have added a love for civic education in my speciality areas of law. I also enjoy going listening to music, hosting and more particularly trying out new recipes on my unsuspecting friends. </p>

                        <h4>Why Your Happiness Is My Priority</h4>
                        <p>I was born in Nyeri but was raised in a small village near Kerugoya, Kirinyaga County. I attended Thaita Primary School and in my final year of primary school attained a sponsorship to Nanyuki Boarding School. I later joined South Tetu Girls in Mukurwe-ini in Nyeri County, University of Nairobi (Parklands Campus) and Kenya School of Law.</p>
                        <p>I underwent pupillage at Musyimi and Company Advocates from January 2014 to 12th March 2015 where under the supervision of the Senior Partner Mrs. Anne Mbugua, I developed a deep interest in litigation. I was admitted to the bar on 13th March 2015 and joined Musyimi & Company as an associate. I have continued nurturing my interest and practice in litigation of commercial and family matters at the firm. I have also developed a deep interest in mediation. When speaking to my clients I put myself in their shoes when it comes to deep family issues and any other issues that cause them disharmony. I can relate to the stress of tough times and I hope I can be part of the remedy to uplift you from your issue.</p>
                        <p>When it comes to my clients, I handle their issues with an open mind. As Max Lucade put it, Conflict is inevitable, but combat is optional. </p>
                        <p>I enjoy swimming, watching movies and sometimes having ice cream. </p>
